# Day 2: Global distribution of biodiversity

2023-06-27

## Quiz

- Visit <https://gosocrative.com> and enter room name NITTA9359, **or** scan the barcode:

## What is biodiversity?

- **The different kinds of life that occur on our planet**

To understand biodiversity, we need to **document** it (describe where it occurs)

## How can we count (quantify) life?

## Population size (abundance)

![](../images/abundance.png)

The **number of individuals** belonging to a species 個体数

---

![](../images/biomass.png)

The **total mass** of organisms 生物量

---

![](../images/richness.png)

The **number of species** 種数

## Counting life

- Population size (abundance): The number of individuals belonging to a species 個体数

- Biomass: The total mass of organisms 生物量

- Richness: The number of species 種数

## Activity: Which is more diverse?

## Species richness is often used, but is not the only way to measure biodiversity

There is no single definition of diversity.

How you measure it depends on your goal and the data available

## Species richness is unevenly distributed

Some areas have **many** species, others have **few**.

## Latitudinal species gradient

The number of species **increases** going **from the poles to the equator**

- latitude = 緯度
- equator = 赤道

## There are many factors that determine richness

- Climate 気候
- Biotic interactions 生物間相互作用
- Evolution 進化
- Humans

These affect ranges of individual species, **and** species richness

## Hotspots are areas of exceptionally high richness

Hotspots have high richness **and** are in danger: these are the areas that we should focus on conserving

- 種の数が極めて多い
- すでにダメージを受けている

## 35 Global Biodiversity Hotspots

## Activity: How do you experience biodiversity?

In your group, discuss:

- Where do you see/experience areas of **high** biodiversity?

- Where do you see/experience areas of **low** biodiversity?

- **Why** do you think there is a difference?

One person per group answer on Socrative

## Activity

- Visit <https://gosocrative.com> and enter room name NITTA9359, **or** scan the barcode:

![](../images/NITTA9359.png){fig-alt="QR code linking to Socrative room for NITTA9359" height="400"}

## What are species anyways?

All of our discussion of biodiversity uses **species** as a unit <br>(単位)

- **But what are species?**

## Species concepts

- There is no one right answer to the question, "What are species?"

- Instead, there are different **species concepts**
  - 種概念、「種」の定義

## Biological Species Concept (BSC)<br>生物学的種概念

- According to the BSC, species are groups of individuals that can **interbreed** with each other, but not other species
  - interbreed = 繁殖する

- Appearance does not matter
  - 見た目は関係ない

## Why the BSC?

- Members of the same species **can exchange genes**

- Members of different species cannot

- Member of the same species are an **evolutionary unit**

## Speciation

## Why measure biodiversity using species?

. . .

- Conceptually simple

- According to the BSC, we are preserving evolutionary units

## Are there any disadvantages to measuring biodiversity with species richness?

. . .

- Does not account for evolutionary history

- The BSC is difficult to test experimentally

- The BSC does not apply to all organisms
