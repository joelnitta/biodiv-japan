## What are species anyways?

In your group, discuss:

- What is a species?

## Species concepts

- There is no one right answer to the question, "What are species?"

- Instead, there are different **species concepts**

## Biological Species Concept (BSC)

- According to the BSC, species are groups of individuals that can **interbreed** and produce **fertile offspring**

## Why the BSC?

- Members of the same species **can exchange genes**

- Members of different species cannot

- Member of the same species are an **evolutionary unit**

## Why measure biodiversity using species?

- Conceptually simple

## Are there any disadvantages to measuring biodiversity with species richness?

- Does not account for evolutionary history

- The BSC is difficult to test experimentally

## How do you experience biodiversity?

In your group, discuss:

- Where do you see/experience areas of **high** biodiversity?

- Where do you see/experience areas of **low** biodiversity?

- Why do you think there is a difference?

## Why does the distribution of species richness vary in space?

- Different species are adapted for different environments

- Only a few species can handle extreme environments

## Why does the distribution of species richness vary in space?

- productivity

## Why does the distribution of species richness vary in space?

- time

## The clearest pattern in richness is the latitudinal species gradient

- Species richness increases going from the poles to the equator

- Due to
  - environmental conditions (including human influence)
  - energy
  - evolutionary time

## Hotspots are areas of remarkably high biodiversity

- We can't conserve everything

- Hotspots are areas to prioritize for conservation
