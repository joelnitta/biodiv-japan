# Day 3: Levels of biodiversity

2023-06-27

## Species concepts

- There is no one right answer to the question, "What are species?"

- Instead, there are different **species concepts**
  - 種概念、「種」の定義

## Biological Species Concept (BSC)<br>生物学的種概念

- According to the BSC, species are groups of individuals that can **interbreed** with each other, but not other species
  - interbreed = 繁殖する

- Appearance does not matter
  - 見た目は関係ない

## Western meadowlark vs. Eastern meadowlark (different species)

## Ant castes (same species)

## Why the BSC?

- Members of the same species **can exchange genes**

- Members of different species cannot

- Member of the same species are an **evolutionary unit**

## Speciation

## Why measure biodiversity using species?

. . .

- Conceptually simple

- According to the BSC, we are preserving evolutionary units

## Are there any disadvantages to measuring biodiversity with species richness?

. . .

- Does not account for evolutionary history

- The BSC is difficult to test experimentally

- The BSC does not apply to all organisms

## Biodiversity is not just about species

- Diversity exists **within** species

- Species have **evolutionary history**

## Alleles

Allele = alternative versions of a gene

アリル = 対立遺伝子。一つの遺伝子に複数の種類があった場合、その一つ。

Phenotype = 表現型  
Genotype = 遺伝子型

## Gene pool

Gene pool = the total genetic diversity within a population or species

## Activity: which is more diverse?

## Populations with low genetic diversity are vulnerable

- Genetic diversity is linked to species-level diversity: if enough populations die, the species may go extinct

## Phylogenetic trees represent evolution

## Phylogenetic trees tell us about biogeography of Japan

## Group Activity: Build a phylogenetic tree

## Activity: Which area is more diverse?

<!-- 
Area 1: three species of plants

Area 2: one tree, one lizard, one insect
-->
