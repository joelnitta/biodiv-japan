## Ice-breaker

- Answer the question: "Why are you interested in biodiversity?"

- Introduce yourself and discuss with your neighbor

## What is biodiversity?

- **The different kinds of life that occur on our planet**

. . .

- Often we talk about the **number of species**, but it has other definitions too

## Why does biodiversity matter?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
1. How would you feel if you could **never visit a natural place** like a forest or the mountains?

## Biodiversity has inherent value

- Biodiversity has **inherent value**: it is worth something **just by existing**

- Biodiversity has **cultural value**: we derive **inspiration** from it

## Why does biodiversity matter?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
1. How would you feel if you **couldn't eat any fruit** because there were no bees to pollinate flowers?

## Humans depend on biodiversity

2. How would you feel if you **didn't have access to clean drinking water** because there were no wetlands to help filter it?

## Why does biodiversity matter?

- Biodiversity provides **ecosystem services**: humans benefit from the natural environment

## Biodiversity is **in danger**

We will learn about the **specific risks** posed to biodiversity, and **actionable measures** to counteract them.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
::: {.incremental}

- Climate change
- Population growth
- Invasive species

- Did you know that **Japan is a biodiversity hotspot?**

- Do you know why?

## Japan as a biodiversity hotspot

Japan has a **wide variation of climates** in a small area

::: {.incremental}
- Species are usually adapted for one particular kind of climate
- This results in many species
:::

## Goals of this class

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- understand the **processes generating biodiversity**
- explain **how biodiversity is distributed** globally and in Japan
- propose ways to effectively **conserve biodiversity**

## Expectations of this class

- I expect you to **participate in discussions**

- I expect you to **ask questions**

## Language of this class

- This class is **conducted in English**

- But, you can ask questions in Japanese and I will explain in Japanese if needed

- **日本語**でも必要に応じて**大丈夫です**。

- とにかく何か分からないことがあったら、<br>聞いてください！

## Structure of this class

- Classic model: Introduce new ideas in class then complete homework assignments about them

- **Flipped model**: Introduce new ideas **ahead of class** in videos, and we will learn more about those topics in depth through in-class discussions

## Videos

- We will watch **videos** from a series on biodiversity produced by the California Academy of Sciences

- Each is video is 5-10 minutes long.

- There are usually 3-4 videos per week.
